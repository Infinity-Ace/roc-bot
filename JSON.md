# JSON
JSON is short for JavaScript Object-Notation
You do not need to use JavaScript to use JSON, such as in our case. A JSON file starts with a __{__ and ends with an __}__, the two curly braces together form a javascript object, and everything between these are the _properties_ of the object. Hence a JSON-file is an object.
## Syntax
Not only the file itself is an object, all the properties inside the object are also objects.
{
another object": {
1:2,
2:7 
}
}
Here, we have an object containing _another object_, every object has an identifier and and a value. The identifier of the file-object mentioned in the beginning is the file itself, so no need to write anything there.
The value of _another object_ is the two objects with the identifiers _1_ and _2_, where _1_ has the value 2, and \_2\_â€“ the value 7.
